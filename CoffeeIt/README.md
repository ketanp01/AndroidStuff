# CoffeeIt

It is an app with the basic UI for ordering a coffee. A user enters his preferences and sends the order via email to the coffee shop.

## Project Description

This project was one of my learning projects. I created it to learn about the basic components of the Android system such as Activity, Intent, Navigation Drawer, and SplashScreen.

### Files Included:

- MainActivity.java: This is the file that contains the whole app code. From showing the flipping image animation to sending the data via a bundle in the intent.
- SplashScreen.java: A basic launching screen that appears whenever the app is started. It lasts for 2 seconds showing the app name and logo.
