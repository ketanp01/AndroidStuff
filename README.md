# MyStuff

This repo contains the android apps that I have developed for fun, to learn, and to implement some ideas that I usually get.

### CoffeeIt

It is an app with the basic UI for ordering a coffee.
A user enters his preferences and sends the order via email to the coffee shop.

### Everything

It is a blogging application that has the functionality to send the post as text. 
Users need to login in order to use the app.

### Sunshine

This app is the project for the Udacity course [Developing Android Apps: Android Fundamentals]
